Predicting board game reviews

This project uses a dataset that contains 80000 board games and their associated review scores. The data was scraped from BoardGameGeek and compiled into CSV format by Sean Beck.

The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict reviews of new board games. The model was built with linear regression using k-fold validation.
